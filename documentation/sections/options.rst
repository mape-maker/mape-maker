 If this option is not given, the simulated timeseries is assumed to be "actuals".
|
* **\\-\\-base_process TEXT**:

 The base process is a timeseries of random variables with marginal law following a normal law of mean 0 and variance 1.
 We then apply a transformation to the base process to retrieve the simulated errors. The base process can either be independent and identically distributed ("iid"), or simulated via an ARMA process ("ARMA"). In the last case, the base process will be correlated, hence the errors will have a stronger correlation than with an "iid" base process.

 The following are the two ways to specify that base process is iid:

 ``--base_process "iid"``

 ``-bp "iid"``

 If this option is not given, the base process is assumed to be "ARMA"
|
* **\\-\\-load_pickle BOOLEAN**:

 This will load the pickle file of the estimated parameters for the input dataset and the output feature instead of re-estimating the parameters for the conditional beta distributions.

 This command can be used to improve the speed of the program by skipping the estimation part. However, it can only happen if a previous run was made for the same input dataset and for the same output feature.

 The following are two ways to specify that mape-maker should load the estimated parameters if they exist:

 ``--load_pickle``

 ``-lp``

 .. note:: Every run of mape-maker will create a new pickle file or update the existing one for that specific input dataset and output feature. The file is stored in the stored_vectors subdirectory in the mape_maker directory.
 If the pickle file does not exist or if this option is not given, then the parameters for the beta distributions are computed.
|
* **\\-\\-curvature BOOLEAN**:
 True if the user wants to optimize the scenarios curvature.

 Curvature is the second difference of the time series of output.
 (If you are not sure whether to use the curvature, you should set it as False)

 The following are two ways to specify that the curvature is True:

 ``--curvature``

 ``-c``

 If this option is not given, the curvature is assumed to be False
|

|
* **\\-\\-plot BOOLEAN**:
 True if the user wants to plot the results.

 The following are two ways to specify to not plot the result:

 ``--plot``

 ``-p``

 If this option is not given, the option is assumed to be True
|
* **\\-\\-solver TEXT**:
 The name of the software that is used to perform the curvature optimization process.

 The following are two ways to specify that the solver is "cplex":

 ``--solver "cplex"``

 ``-sv "cplex"``

 If this option is not given, the solver is assumed to be "gurobi".
|
* **\\-\\-title TEXT**:
 The title of the simulation plot.

 The following are two ways to specify the title of the simulation plot as "my plot":

 ``--title "my plot"``

 ``-tt "my plot"``

 If this option is not given, the title of the simulation plot is assumed to be None. Therefore, no additional title will be added to the plot.
|
* **\\-\\-x_legend TEXT**:
 The x legend of the simulation plot.

 The following are two ways to specify the x legend of the simulation plot as "x legend":

 ``--x_legend "x legend"``

 ``-xl "x legend"``
