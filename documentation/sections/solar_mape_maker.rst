.. _solar_mape_maker:

solar_mape_maker
================
The ``solar_mape_maker.py`` program enables creation of scenario files using solar data.
It calculates the difference between the input data and upper bound of solar energy generation at the same time 
as the input data. The upper bound uses the maximum of clear-sky POA from the location parameters users put in,
and the algorithm is described in *Constructing probabilistic scenarios for wide-area solar power generation* by David L. Woodruff, et al. (<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2017.11.067>, see citing section for more information).

This difference is used to feed in ``Mape_Maker`` to generate scenarios. Then the output of ``Mape_Maker`` is added
to the upper bound to create the final solar scenarios.

 The base process is a timeseries of random variables with marginal law following a normal law of mean 0 and variance 1.
 We then apply a transformation to the base process to retrieve the simulated errors. The base process can either be independent and identically distributed ("iid"), or simulated via an ARMA process ("ARMA"). In the last case, the base process will be correlated, hence the errors will have a stronger correlation than with an "iid" base process.

 The following are the two ways to specify that base process is iid:

 If this option is not given, the base process is assumed to be "ARMA"
|
* **\\-\\-load_pickle BOOLEAN**:

 This will load the pickle file of the estimated parameters for the input dataset and the output feature instead of re-estimating the parameters for the conditional beta distributions.

 This command can be used to improve the speed of the program by skipping the estimation part. However, it can only happen if a previous run was made for the same input dataset and for the same output feature.

 The following are two ways to specify that mape-maker should load the estimated parameters if they exist:

 ``--load_pickle``

 ``-lp``

 .. note:: Every run of mape-maker will create a new pickle file or update the existing one for that specific input dataset and output feature. The file is stored in the stored_vectors subdirectory in the mape_maker directory.
 If the pickle file does not exist or if this option is not given, then the parameters for the beta distributions are computed.
|
