Unittest
---------

wind_quick_test.py
+++++++++++++++++++

* This test is used to see whether the above command lines will run successfully at once.
* You can run this unittest by typing "python wind_quick_test.py" in your terminal.
* wine_quick_test.py will first save the current working directory and change to a temporary directory. It will then run the above command lines and save the output dir to the folder where you run the tests. Finally, it will return back to the previous directory once the unittest is finished.
* Since command 3 and command 4 are similar to command 1 and command 2, if you want to save the running time, you can skip the last two tests by setting "skip_test"(line 16) to False.

.. figure::  ../_static/skip_test_line.png
   :align:   center


wind_slow_test.py
++++++++++++++++++

* The difference between wind_quick_test.py and wind_slow_test.py is that the second one will show more details. After running each above command line, it will find the difference between simulation 1 and simulation 2 in each row, then save the result to a csv file called "simulation_comparison". At the same time, it will also plot the simulation differences and save the graph called "simulation_plot".
* As you can see the picture below, "simulation_comparison" add a new column called "simulation_1_minus_2" comparing to the original output file.

.. figure::  ../_static/sample_simulation_diff.png
   :align:   center

* The "simulation_plot" will show a set of blue dots, where the y-axis represents the range of differences, and the x-axis stands for the dates(from start date to end date).

.. figure::  ../_static/sample_plot.png
   :align:   center



Setup
******

* Your python version should be at 3.x.x(i.e 3.7.1). You can check your current version by typing "python --version" in your terminal.
* If you want to initialize and use the curvature, you need to install a Quadratic MIP solver such as "Gurobi" first: www.gurobi.com/
(e.g Gurobi, Cplex, SCJP, etc.)

1. Click on "Clone or download" to copy the web URL.
2. Switch to a proper directory and then type:

::

    git clone + the web URL link that you copied

to clone the entire "mape_maker_v2" to your own directory

3. Install the package with the setup.py file:

::

    python setup.py develop


4. You can use the package in command-line, for a quick-first run :

::

    python -m mape_maker "mape_maker/samples/wind_total_forecast_actual_070113_063015.csv"


Input file format
*******************

If you want to use your own datafile as an input to run the mape_maker, then the input file format should be:

* Datetime as the first column, format as "year-month-day + time". i.e: 2017-1-3 00:00
* Forecast data as the second column, format as "float". i.e: 3264.59
* Actual data as the third column, format as "float". i.e: 3264.59
